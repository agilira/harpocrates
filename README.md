## Compatibility and Support

Harpocrates supports the latest two minor versions of Go (currently Go 1.24+ and Go 1.25+) and follows Long-Term Support guidelines to ensure consistent performance across production deployments.

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/agilira/harpocrates
```

### Release Verification
All releases are cryptographically signed with GitHub attestations. Verify authenticity:
```bash
gh attestation verify ./harpocrates-* --owner agilira
```

## Quick Examples

### Basic Encryption/Decryption
```go
import crypto "github.com/agilira/harpocrates"

key, err := crypto.GenerateKey()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// For text data (convenience functions)
ciphertext, err := crypto.Encrypt("secret data", key)
plaintext, err := crypto.Decrypt(ciphertext, key)

// For binary data (core functions - recommended)
binaryData := []byte{0x00, 0x01, 0xFF, 0xFE}
ciphertext, err := crypto.EncryptBytes(binaryData, key)
decrypted, err := crypto.DecryptBytes(ciphertext, key)
```

### Zero-Downtime Key Rotation
```go
// Initialize key manager
km := crypto.NewKeyManager()

// Current way: immediate rotation (brief downtime)
newKEK, err := km.RotateKEK("purpose")

// New way: zero-downtime rotation
newKEK, err := km.RotateKEKZeroDowntime("purpose")

// Or step-by-step control
pendingKEK, err := km.PrepareKEKRotation("purpose")  // Phase 1: prepare
err = km.ValidateKEKRotation()                       // Phase 2: validate  
err = km.CommitKEKRotation()                         // Phase 3: commit
// err = km.RollbackKEKRotation()                    // Emergency rollback
```

### Streaming Large Data
```go
// For large files/datasets (GB-scale)
key, _ := crypto.GenerateKey()

// Streaming encryption
encryptor, err := crypto.NewStreamingEncryptor(outputWriter, key)
defer encryptor.Close()
io.Copy(encryptor, inputReader) // Encrypts while streaming

// Streaming decryption  
decryptor, err := crypto.NewStreamingDecryptor(inputReader, key)
defer decryptor.Close()
io.Copy(outputWriter, decryptor) // Decrypts while streaming
```

### Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration
```go
// Initialize HSM with go-plugins gRPC interface
hsm, err := crypto.NewHSM("pkcs11", map[string]interface{}{
    "plugin_path":  "./plugins/hsm-pkcs11",
    "grpc_address": "localhost:50051",
    "slot_id":      0,
    "pin":          "1234",
})
defer hsm.Close()

// Generate key in HSM hardware
keyHandle, err := hsm.GenerateKey("vault-master-kek", 32)

// Hardware-protected encryption
ciphertext, err := hsm.Encrypt(keyHandle, []byte("sensitive data"))
plaintext, err := hsm.Decrypt(keyHandle, ciphertext)
```

### Advanced Key Derivation
```go
password := []byte("my-secure-password")
salt := []byte("random-salt-123")

// Argon2id (recommended)
key, err := crypto.DeriveKeyDefault(password, salt, 32)

// HKDF for hierarchical keys
context := []byte("user-session-keys")
sessionKey, err := crypto.DeriveKeyHKDF(masterKey, salt, context, 32)

// Custom Argon2 parameters
key, err := crypto.DeriveKeyWithParams(password, salt, 3, 64*1024, 4, 32)
```

## The Philosophy Behind Harpocrates

Harpocrates, the child of silence, understood what others could not grasp. In ancient temples, when priests whispered the most sacred incantations, when merchants sealed their most valuable contracts, when lovers shared their deepest secrets—Harpocrates was there, finger raised to his lips, guardian of what must never be spoken aloud.

The young god knew that true power lay not in the message itself, but in ensuring that only the intended could hear it. His silence was not empty—it was full of protection. Each secret he guarded was wrapped in layers of divine safekeeping, accessible only to those who possessed the proper keys to unlock his trust.

In the halls of Alexandria's great library, scholars would invoke Harpocrates before transcribing their most precious knowledge, knowing that the god of silence would ensure their wisdom reached only worthy hands across the centuries.

### Building

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
./build.sh              # Development build (debug symbols preserved)
./build.sh --strip      # Production build (debug symbols stripped)

# Windows PowerShell
.\build.ps1              # Development build (debug symbols preserved)  
.\build.ps1 -Strip       # Production build (debug symbols stripped)
```
All build scripts use `-trimpath` and `-buildid=` flags to ensure bit-for-bit reproducible builds

### Running Tests

```bash
make test         # Use the Makefile for comprehensive testing
make check        # Run all quality checks (tests + linting + security)
make security     # Run security analysis and fuzz testing
```
Use `Makefile` on Unix systems or `Makefile.ps1` on Windows PowerShell.
